# Agentic AI Workflow Orchestrator 

### Purpose  
This project explores how “agentic AI” — autonomous, multi-step reasoning powered by large language models — can automate complex workflows in business and operations.  
The goal is to create a lightweight orchestration layer that connects APIs, databases, and logic steps into reusable intelligent agents.  

### What It Does  
Runs modular AI workflows with clearly defined input/output steps  
Supports context passing between reasoning modules (e.g., summarization → planning → action)  
Connects external APIs such as Google Search, Notion, or Slack  
Logs execution traces for explainability  

### Example Use Case  
 Automate the daily marketing performance summary:  
1. Pull data from an analytics API  
2. Summarize key metrics using GPT  
3. Generate insights and recommended next steps  
4. Email the report to stakeholders  

### Example Output  
Top Insight: Conversion rate rose 14% week-over-week, primarily driven by organic traffic from healthcare content.
Recommendation: Scale LinkedIn campaigns targeting Pharma CXOs and integrate audience insights into next week’s creative planning
### Tech Stack  
 **Python 3.10+**  
**LangChain or LlamaIndex** for workflow composition  
**OpenAI API** for reasoning  
**Requests + JSON** for external integrations  


### Why I Built It  
I’ve seen firsthand how repetitive, insight-heavy workflows slow down decision-making in enterprise settings.  
This project is an experiment in designing **AI systems that think, plan, and act**  not just generate text.  
It brings together lessons from leading AI transformations at Genentech, Salesforce, and Amazon to build practical agentic architectures that deliver measurable business outcomes.  



### Future Enhancements  
Add a vector database for contextual memory  
Build a Streamlit interface for visualizing multi-agent conversations  
Add task parallelization and retry logic
